# doublon_remorver
doublon_remorver is a software to delete or locate your files (originals and duplicates) and takes care of deleting them for you while keeping the original (established on the precise date of creation of the file)

to use it, nothing could be simpler for Windows machines, just run the setup.bat file (the requirements file must be in the same folder as it) and then just run the code via the " python duplicate_remove .py" in cmd

WARNING: the software takes care of deleting all the duplicates and keeps the original ones but it also takes care of the empty folders it does the cleaning in some nevertheless know that it also takes care of the parent folder because yes for the program to work it must be in the folder that contains all the images as well as the empty subfolders or with images (and video) therefore if you run it in the parent folder but there are duplicates that you want to keep it will be lost
