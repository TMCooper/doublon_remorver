# doublon_remorver
doublon_remorver is a software to delete or locate your files (original and duplicates) and takes care of deleting them for you by keeping the original (established on the precise date of creation of the file)

to use it, nothing could be simpler for Windows machines, you just have to execute the setup.bat file (the requirements file must be in the same folder as it) and then you only have to execute the code via the command "python duplicate_remove.py" in the cmd
